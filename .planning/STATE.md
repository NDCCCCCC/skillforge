# State — SkillForge

**Last updated:** 2026-08-10
**Project:** SkillForge (Skill-driven enterprise Agent platform)
**Mode:** mvp (vertical slices)

---

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Same agent kernel, customized per enterprise via pluggable Skill files — without code changes. From "application" to "platform" via the Skill schema; from "AI wrapper" (dead, Height.app closed 2025.9) to defensible Skill-driven platform.

**Demo Skill:** 企业合规 / 制度审查 — the showcase Skill that proves the platform thesis (compliance is the killer use case because hallucination is unacceptable).

**Audience:** Open-source personal brand. Quality bar = a stranger can fork, run, and benchmark.

**Stack (locked):** Go + Eino v0.7.7 (ADK GA) + Hertz SSE + Milvus (tier-filtered) + BGE-M3 + Ragas (Python sidecar) + React 19 + Vite + TS + Vercel AI SDK v5 + shadcn / Tailwind v4.

**License:** Apache-2.0.

---

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 — Integration Spike & Trust Contract
**Plan:** TBD
**Status:** Ready to execute
**Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 1` (or create spike plan directly)

---

## Decisions (from PROJECT.md + SUMMARY.md)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D1 | Go + Eino (not Python / full TS) | User fluency in Go; denova fork as mature reference; surfaces agent engineering depth over web iteration speed |
| D2 | Skill-driven, not fixed-function agent | Promotes app → platform; updates adapt enterprise needs with no code change |
| D3 | Built-in demo Skill = 企业合规 / 制度审查 | Sharp pain (no tolerable hallucination); natural fit for true-source separation; refusal mechanism shines |
| D4 | Audience = OSS personal brand | Polish docs + easy start + measurable outcomes (not just interview-project) |
| D5 | Skill schema = 6 fields with explicit `reads` / `writes` | Makes denova's implicit boundaries auditable + wizard-generatable |
| D6 | Ragas as Python sidecar for eval | Best-in-class faithfulness / context precision / answer relevance; Go bindings thin; sidecar is the established pattern |
| D7 | Milvus tier as mandatory metadata field | No collection-per-tier (couples ops); tier-filter expr before similarity is the hard barrier |
| D8 | Citation = chunk ID + span | Free-text citations are the #1 hallucination vector (P-COMPL-1) |
| D9 | Refusal-by-construction on missing tier-match | Default-deny; never improvise (GEVL-02, KNOW-04) |
| D10 | Self-RAG / CRAG self-verification | Re-read & verify claims before final answer (ARAG-03) |

## Accumulated Context

**Open questions (from research SUMMARY.md):**

1. Whether `name` is part of the 6-field schema or an external manifest identity
2. Public / legally-safe CN compliance dataset acquisition strategy
3. Exact citation-entailment verification method
4. Retrieval / refusal / confidence / HITL threshold values (empirical calibration required)
5. Metadata filter vs separate Milvus collections for tier isolation trade-off
6. Policy version conflict semantics (when 权威 and 历史 disagree)
7. Audit retention + redaction + access control requirements
8. Eval set composition: synthetic vs real-user sampling for compliance domain

**Research flags (phase-specific research needed):**

- Phase 1: Eino APIs in depth, Hertz-to-AI-SDK v5 transport, Milvus filter expression syntax
- Phase 3: Chinese eval dataset sourcing, BGE-M3 reranker choice (self-host via TEI vs API), Ragas judge calibration
- Phase 5: hot reload for in-flight conversations, cross-tier conflict policy, historical tier storage, multi-agent value proof
- Phase 6: audit privacy (retention / redaction / access control), reproducibility, CI evaluation cost

## Session Continuity

**Resume point:** Open `.planning/ROADMAP.md` to see the current phase. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to generate the Phase 1 spike plan.

**Hot files this session:**

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — core value + decisions
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — 55 v1 requirements + traceability
- `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` — stack locked, pitfalls, recommended 7-phase order
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure (this file's sibling)
- `.planning/STATE.md` — this file
